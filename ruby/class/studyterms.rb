.odd? # will determine if number is odd
.even? #will check if number is even
.length #will calculate how long something is 
.shift #high number (head of list)
.pop #lowest seeded ot back of the list 
to_s #will help to print string out once defined as method example 
     # def to_s 
      #   "#{@seed}, #{@name}"

\n #puts everything in a new line or the next line 
.parse #string input can be used date.parse('2017-10-09') => 2017-10-09
